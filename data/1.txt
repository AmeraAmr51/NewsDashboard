Liverpool's Mohamed Salah has been ruled out of Egypt's upcoming matches against Kenya and Comoros with an ankle injury.

Egypt confirmed Salah's absence with pictures of the forward wearing a protective boot on his left ankle.
He has been suffering with ongoing soreness in his ankle since the win over Leicester on October 5, and had to be substituted towards the end of the 2-1 win over Tottenham two weeks ago.

Salah had indicated his desire to play for his country, the Egyptian Football Association said, but was ruled out following a meeting between the national team doctor, head coach and captain.
