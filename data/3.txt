Economic growth likely slowed for the second consecutive quarter in Q2 FY 2020, which ran from October to December, as suggested by a decrease in the quarter’s non-oil private sector PMI reading compared to the previous quarter. Weak demand hampered non-oil private sector activity, contributing to falling employment in November and December. Moreover, merchandise export growth was downbeat in October–November, while imports tumbled, suggesting domestic demand was weak in Q2. Turning to Q3, the non-oil private sector PMI dropped to the lowest level in over two-and-a-half years in January, mainly due to fewer export orders. On a brighter note, international reserves, which have been climbing since Egypt began the three-year IMF program in 2016, rose to USD 45.5 billion in January. 
Growth should stabilize in FY 2020, after accelerating for the second year running in FY 2019. Particularly, higher government spending, improved ease of doing business and lower interest rates should support growth. However, lingering global trade tensions and domestic security scares will likely weigh on the external sector.
